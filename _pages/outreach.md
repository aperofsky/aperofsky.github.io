- Volunteer for [Science Under the Stars](https://scienceunderthestars.org/), a monthly, public outdoor lecture series founded and organized by graduate students in the Department of Integrative Biology at UT-Austin. In Fall 2016, I gave a SUTS presentation on [lemur ecology, evolutionary history, and outreach efforts]((http://dailytexanonline.com/2016/11/13/science-under-the-stars-lecture-features-lemurs). 

- I have written about [my field research experiences](https://www3.beacon-center.org/blog/2016/03/14/how-lemur-social-networks-shape-microbial-transmission/) for the [BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action's](https://www3.beacon-center.org/) "Researchers at Work" blog series.
