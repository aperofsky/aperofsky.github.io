- 2019-2021: Member, NIH Science Policy Discussion Group (SPDG). The NIH SPDG is a fellow-led and run self-governing organization that brings together fellows with a shared passion for understanding the intersection of scientific research and legislative policy. I wrote essays about [COVID-19 vaccine mandates](https://sciencepolicyforall.wordpress.com/2021/06/10/can-the-united-states-achieve-herd-immunity-vaccine-mandates-and-other-policies-to-increase-covid-19-vaccination/) and [the role of COVID-19 forecasting models in policy decisions](https://sciencepolicyforall.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/the-use-of-covid-19-prediction-models-in-guiding-policy-decisions/).

- 2018-2019: Co-instructor for [MISMS training workshops](http://misms.net/) on infectious disease quantitative analysis methods, including time-series modeling, epidemiological modeling, and phylogenetic analysis. 

- 2011-2018: Co-host of [They Blinded Me With Science](https://www.facebook.com/tbmwskvrx), a weekly educational radio program on [KVRX 91.7 FM](http://kvrx.org/) that features guest researchers and discussion of current publications. I recruited guests, conducted interviews, and produced podcasts that are available for download on [Podbean](http://tbmws.podbean.com/) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/they-blinded-me-with-science/id908731079?mt=2).

- 2011-2017: Volunteer and co-organizer for [Science Under the Stars](https://scienceunderthestars.org/), a monthly, public outdoor lecture series founded and organized by graduate students in the Department of Integrative Biology at UT-Austin. In Fall 2016, I gave a SUTS presentation on [lemur ecology, evolutionary history, and outreach efforts](http://dailytexanonline.com/2016/11/13/science-under-the-stars-lecture-features-lemurs). 

- I wrote about [my field research experiences](https://www3.beacon-center.org/blog/2016/03/14/how-lemur-social-networks-shape-microbial-transmission/) for the [BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action's](https://www3.beacon-center.org/) "Researchers at Work" blog series.
