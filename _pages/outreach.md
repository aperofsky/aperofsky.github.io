Co-host of [They Blinded Me With Science](https://www.facebook.com/tbmwskvrx), a weekly educational program on [KVRX 91.7 FM](http://kvrx.org/) that features guest researchers and discussion of current publications. I recruit guests, conduct interviews, and produce podcasts that are available for download on [Podbean](http://tbmws.podbean.com/) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/they-blinded-me-with-science/id908731079?mt=2). 

Volunteer for [Science Under the Stars](https://scienceunderthestars.org/), a monthly, public outdoor lecture series founded and organized by graduate students in the Department of Integrative Biology at UT-Austin.

I have written about [my field research experiences](https://www3.beacon-center.org/blog/2016/03/14/how-lemur-social-networks-shape-microbial-transmission/) for the [BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action's](https://www3.beacon-center.org/) "Researchers at Work" blog series.
