## Training workshops

- 2024: Tutor, [Complexity 72h](https://complexity72h.com/), an interdisciplinary workshop for young researchers in complex systems, Carlos III University of Madrid, Spain. Led and mentored a team of 5 graduate students in carrying out a research project within 3 days (i.e., 72h). Project title: “Impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on mobility networks and the spread of endemic respiratory viruses”

- 2018-2019: Co-instructor, Fogarty International Center [training workshops](https://www.fic.nih.gov/About/Staff/multinational-influenza-seasonal-mortality-study-misms) on infectious disease quantitative analysis methods, including time-series modeling, epidemiological modeling, and phylogenetic analysis. 

## Science outreach and advocacy

- 2019-2021: Member, [NIH Science Policy Discussion Group](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scipolicyforall/), Bethesda, MD. NIH SPDG is a biweekly seminar series for early-career scientists focused on the intersection of scientific research and legislative policy.

- 2018: Selected speaker, [American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Classroom Science Days](https://www.aaas.org/news/aaas-connects-scientists-and-students-classroom-science-days), Austin, TX. I gave an outreach lecture ("Meet the Lemurs") to middle school students.

- 2016: Public outreach lecture on [lemur ecology, evolutionary history, and conservation efforts](https://thedailytexan.com/2016/11/14/science-under-the-stars-lecture-features-lemurs/), Science Under the Stars, Austin, TX.

- 2011-2018: Co-host, [They Blinded Me With Science](https://www.facebook.com/tbmwskvrx) on [KVRX 91.7 FM](http://kvrx.org/) (UT-Austin's student-run radio station). TBMWS was a weekly educational talk show that interviewed UT-based and visiting researchers and reviewed science publications and news.

- 2011-2017: Volunteer and co-organizer, [Science Under the Stars](https://scienceunderthestars.org/), Austin, TX. SUTS is a free, monthly public outreach lecture series founded and organized by graduate students in the Department of Integrative Biology at UT-Austin.

## Science writing

- In 2020 and 2021, I wrote essays for NIH SPDG's science policy blog [Science Policy for All](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scipolicyforall/) about [COVID-19 vaccine mandates](https://sciencepolicyforall.wordpress.com/2021/06/10/can-the-united-states-achieve-herd-immunity-vaccine-mandates-and-other-policies-to-increase-covid-19-vaccination/) and [the role of COVID-19 forecasting models in policy decisions](https://sciencepolicyforall.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/the-use-of-covid-19-prediction-models-in-guiding-policy-decisions/).

- In 2016, I wrote about my [field research experiences](https://www3.beacon-center.org/blog/2016/03/14/how-lemur-social-networks-shape-microbial-transmission/) for [NSF BEACON's](https://www3.beacon-center.org/) "Researchers at Work" blog series.
