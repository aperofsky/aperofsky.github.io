## The impact of human mobility on respiratory virus transmission

During the COVID-19 pandemic, aggregated location data from mobile phones became an important source of information on changes in population-level movements and the effectiveness of prevention and control measures in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 spread. I began working with cellphone mobility data in 2020, first to inform forecasts of respiratory virus outbreaks on US military bases for US DoD, and then to retrospectively relate changes in mobility to healthcare-seeking behavior in South Africa and respiratory virus transmission dynamics in Seattle.

### Ongoing research: Mobility behvaior and respiratory virus transmission dynamics in the Seattle metropolitan area
Although many studies have used cellphone mobility data to model SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, relationships between mobility behavior and the transmission of endemic respiratory pathogens are less understood. As a research scientist for the [Seattle Flu Alliance](https://seattleflu.org/), I studied how population mobility and COVID-19 public health measures influenced the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and 17 endemic respiratory viruses in the greater Seattle region during pre- and post-pandemic years (2018 - 2022) ([Perofsky _et al._ 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48528-2)). As an extension of this study, we are using data-driven mechanistic transmission models to assess the relative effects of waning immunity and decreased social distancing on the post-pandemic reemergence of RSV in Seattle. I have also worked with members of [Trevor Bedford's group (Fred Hutch)](https://bedford.io/) to relate cellphone mobility patterns to the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in [Seattle-King County](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012117) and [Washington state](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.24.24307811).

## Ecological and evolutionary drivers of influenza outbreaks in human and animal populations

### The effects of antigenic drift and subtype interference on annual influenza epidemics in the United States 

Collaborators: [Cécile Viboud (NIH)](https://www.fic.nih.gov/About/Staff/epidemiology-population-studies/Pages/default.aspx), [John Huddleston (Fred Hutch)](https://bedford.io/team/john-huddleston/), [Trevor Bedford (Fred Hutch)](https://bedford.io/), [Florian Krammer (Mt. Sinai)](https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/krammerlab/dr-krammer/), [WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) Collaborating Centers in Atlanta, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo](https://www.who.int/initiatives/global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system)

Influenza viruses continually accumulate genetic changes in epitopes of two major surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), in a process known as “antigenic drift.” Antigenic drift helps the virus to escape immune recognition, leaving previously exposed individuals susceptible to reinfection and necessitating regular updates to the flu vaccine. Antigenic drift is expected to lead to more susceptible individuals and flu cases, in turn leading to earlier, larger, or more severe epidemics. However, prior evidence for the impact of antigenic drift on seasonal influenza outbreaks is conflicting. 

In a recent [_eLife_ article](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.91849.2), we systematically compared experimental and sequence-based measures of A(H3N2) evolution in predicting regional epidemic dynamics in the US across 22 seasons, from 1997 to 2019. We also considered the effects of other co-circulating flu viruses, prior immunity, and vaccine-related parameters on A(H3N2) incidence. We found that evolution in both major surface proteins contributes to variability in epidemic magnitude across seasons, though viral evolution appears to be secondary to subtype interference in shaping annual outbreaks. When comparing the predictive performance of different evolutionary indicators, genetic changes in broad sets of epitope sites had stronger, more consistent relationships with A(H3N2) epidemic dynamics than the serological assays traditionally used to measure how flu viruses change from season to season. As an extension of this work, we are studying the effects of antigenic drift and prior population immunity on A(H3N2) vaccine effectiveness in the US.

### Influenza transmission dynamics among exhibition swine in the United States Midwest

Collaborators: [Martha Nelson (NIH)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eQaR4ywAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Andrew Bowman's group (Ohio State)](https://vet.osu.edu/preventive-medicine/vpm-research/animal-influenza-ecology-epidemiology-research-program)

Every summer in the US, youths attending agricultural fairs are exposed to genetically diverse influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulating in exhibition swine, resulting in hundreds of lab-confirmed zoonotic infections since 2010. Exhibition swine represent a small, defined population (1.5% of the U.S. herd), presenting a realistic opportunity to mitigate a pandemic threat. We analyzed virologic surveillance data collected from thousands of pigs attending 350 national, state, and local swine exhibitions across several states during 2016–2018. 

Key findings include: 
* An early-season national show played a key role in the propagation and spatial dissemination of a specific virus (H1 δ-2) that became dominant among exhibition swine and was associated with the majority of zoonotic infections in 2018.
* The earlier timing of jackpot shows and long-distance travel for repeated showing of individual pigs provides a pathway for the introduction of influenza into county fairs. Jackpot shows are held at the beginning of the "show season" to specifically to show swine and do not include the community festival attractions typically found at state and county fairs.

## Doctoral research: Ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral determinants of gut microbiomes in Malagasy mammals.

Advisor: [Lauren Ancel Meyers (UT-Austin)](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/); Collaborators: [Rebecca Lewis (UT-Austin)](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/anthropology/faculty/rl2273), [Anthony Di Fiore (UT-Austin)](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/anthropology/faculty/ad26693)

Mammalian gut microbial communities govern host development, metabolism, immune function, and physiology, through interactions that range from commensal and mutualistic to pathogenic. However, the relative contributions of vertical, horizontal, and environmental transmission to gut microbiome composition are not well understood. For my PhD research, I integrated field-collected data, molecular analyses, and computational and statistical approaches to study how social networks and proximity to other host species influence bacteria transmission and gut microbiome composition among the wild mammals inhabiting Kirindy Mitea National Park in western Madagascar. This research was conducted as part of [The Sifaka Research Project](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/ankoatsifaka/), a long-term research study led by [Dr. Rebecca Lewis (UT-Austin)](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/anthropology/faculty/rl2273).

Key findings include: 
* In a single season, the gut microbiomes of wild Verreaux’s sifaka (_Propithecus verreauxi_) clearly reflect their social group membership, and both grooming and scent-marking behaviors promote microbial exchange and within-host diversity.
* Sifaka social groups harbor distinct gut microbial communities over the course of several years, and compositional changes in the microbiota of individual animals are influenced by the gain or loss of unique social partners and male dispersal between groups.
* The ecological relationships among mammalian gut microbiomes mirror their hosts’ phylogeny. However, the predicted functionality of lemur microbiomes differentiate according to diet, and distantly-related terrestrial mammals have overlapping microbial communities, suggesting that ground dwelling facilitates the indirect horizontal transmission of gut bacteria among sympatric wild mammals. 

Together, these findings demonstrate that patterns of gut microbiome composition in wild mammals are scale-dependent: host phylogeny, diet, and substrate use shape microbial variation among sympatric mammal taxa, while social groupings and social contacts constrain the horizontal transmission of gut bacteria within a single host population.

## Predoctoral Research

I graduated from the University of Georgia with degrees in Biology and Ecology. My undergraduate research focused on salamander ecology and population modeling ([Maerz Lab, UGA](http://jcmaerz.wixsite.com/maerzlab)). After finishing my degree, I worked as a research assistant in [Andrew Park's Lab (UGA)](http://parklab.ecology.uga.edu/) investigating the environmental drivers of hemorrhagic disease outbreaks in white-tailed deer. As a National Institutes of Health post-baccalaureate fellow, I characterized the viral infection profiles of patients with Sjögren’s Syndrome, an autoimmune disorder ([AAV Biology Section, Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/conducted-at-nidcr/investigators/john-chiorini)).
