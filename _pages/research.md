## Research Interests

## Postdoctoral research: Epidemiology and transmission dynamics of respiratory viruses

My current research focuses on the epidemiology, ecology, and transmission dynamics of respiratory viruses in human and animal populations. 

### Research Projects: 
- The impact of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions and social distancing on the transmission dynamics of endemic respiratory pathogens in Seattle, Washington, with [Cécile Viboud (NIH)](http://misms.net/staff/cecile-viboud/) as part of the [Seattle Flu Study](https://seattleflu.org/)
- The impact of antigenic drift on seasonal influenza epidemics and vaccine effectiveness, with [Cécile Viboud (NIH)](http://misms.net/staff/cecile-viboud/) and [Trevor Bedford's group (Fred Hutch)](https://bedford.io/).
- Short-term forecasting of COVID-19 and influenza-like illness (ILI) cases on United States military bases: [DoD Influenza Forecasting Challenge](https://predict.cdc.gov/) and DoD COVID+ILI forecasting collaboration
- The direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on private healthcare utilization in South Africa, with the [National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD)](https://www.nicd.ac.za/)
- Utilizing excess respiratory encounters at hospitals, emergency departments, and primary care providers to monitor COVID-19 activity in South Africa, with the [National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD)](https://www.nicd.ac.za/). [Bi-weekly reports](https://www.nicd.ac.za/diseases-a-z-index/covid-19/surveillance-reports/private-consultations-excess-respiratory-encounters/)
- Influenza transmission dynamics among exhibition swine in the United States Midwest, with [Martha Nelson (NIH)](http://misms.net/staff/martha-nelson/) and [Andrew Bowman's group (Ohio State)](https://cph.osu.edu/people/abowman)

## PhD Research: Ecological, Evolutionary, and Behavioral Determinants of Gut Microbiome Composition in Wild Lemurs

For my doctoral research, I studied how contact networks and proximity to other host species influence gut microbiome composition and plasticity in wild lemurs. This research focused on a population of wild Verreaux’s sifaka inhabiting Kirindy Mitea National Park in western Madagascar and was in close collaboration with Rebecca Lewis (Department of Anthropology, UT-Austin), the director of a long-term sifaka research study in Kirindy Mitea (the [Sifaka Research Project](http://labs.la.utexas.edu/ankoatsifaka/sifaka-research-project/)).

### Projects

### Hierarchical social networks shape gut microbial composition in wild sifaka ([Manuscript](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1868/20172274))

### Terrestriality and bacterial transfer: A comparative study of gut microbiomes in sympatric Malagasy mammals ([Manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/293282))

### Social groups constrain the spatiotemporal dynamics of wild sifaka gut microbiomes (_Manuscript under revision_)

## Background

I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2009 with degrees in Biology and Ecology. My undergraduate research focused on salamander ecology and population modeling ([Maerz Lab](http://jcmaerz.wixsite.com/maerzlab), University of Georgia). After graduating, I worked as a research assistant in the [Park Lab](http://parklab.ecology.uga.edu/) (University of Georgia) investigating the environmental drivers of hemorrhagic disease outbreaks in white-tailed deer. As a National Institutes of Health post-baccalaureate fellow, I characterized viral profiles unique to Sjögren’s Syndrome ([Adeno-Associated Virus Biology Section, MPTB, NIDCR](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/NIDCRLaboratories/MolecularPhysiology/Adeno-AssociatedVirus.htm)).
