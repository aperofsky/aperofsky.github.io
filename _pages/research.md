## Research Interests

## Postdoctoral research: Epidemiology and transmission dynamics of respiratory viruses

### Ongoing Research: 
- The effects of population behavior, masking, and COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions on the transmission dynamics of endemic respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in Seattle, Washington, with [Cécile Viboud (NIH)](https://www.fic.nih.gov/About/Staff/epidemiology-population-studies/Pages/default.aspx) as part of the [Seattle Flu Alliance](https://seattleflu.org/)
- The impact of antigenic drift on seasonal influenza epidemics and vaccine effectiveness, with [Cécile Viboud (NIH)](https://www.fic.nih.gov/About/Staff/epidemiology-population-studies/Pages/default.aspx) and [Trevor Bedford's group (Fred Hutch)](https://bedford.io/)
- Long-term scenario projections and short-term forecasts of influenza hospitalizations in the United States: [Flu Scenario Modeling Hub](https://fluscenariomodelinghub.org/) and [CDC FluSight Forecasting Collaboration](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/index.html)

### Past Post-Doctoral Research Projects:
- The direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on private healthcare utilization in South Africa, with the [National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD)](https://www.nicd.ac.za/)
- Utilizing excess respiratory encounters at hospitals, emergency departments, and primary care providers to monitor COVID-19 and RSV activity in South Africa, with the [National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD)](https://www.nicd.ac.za/). [Reports](https://www.nicd.ac.za/diseases-a-z-index/disease-index-covid-19/surveillance-reports/private-consultations-excess-respiratory-encounters/)
- Short-term forecasts of COVID-19 and influenza-like illness (ILI) cases on United States military bases: [DoD Influenza Forecasting Challenge](https://predict.cdc.gov/) and DoD COVID+ILI forecasting collaboration (2019-2022)
- Influenza transmission dynamics among exhibition swine in the United States Midwest, with Martha Nelson (NIH) and [Andrew Bowman's group (Ohio State)](https://vet.osu.edu/preventive-medicine/vpm-research/animal-influenza-ecology-epidemiology-research-program)

## PhD Research: Ecological, Evolutionary, and Behavioral Determinants of Gut Microbiome Composition in Wild Lemurs

At UT-Austin, I studied how contact networks and proximity to other host species influence gut microbiome composition in wild lemurs. This research focused on a population of wild Verreaux’s sifaka in Kirindy Mitea National Park, Madagascar and was conducted as part of [The Sifaka Research Project](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/ankoatsifaka/), a long-term research study in Kirindy Mitea.

## Predoctoral Research

I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2009 with degrees in Biology and Ecology. My undergraduate research focused on salamander ecology and population modeling ([Maerz Lab](http://jcmaerz.wixsite.com/maerzlab), University of Georgia). After graduating, I worked as a research assistant in the [Park Lab](http://parklab.ecology.uga.edu/) (University of Georgia) investigating the environmental drivers of hemorrhagic disease outbreaks in white-tailed deer. As a National Institutes of Health post-baccalaureate fellow, I characterized viral profiles unique to Sjögren’s Syndrome ([Adeno-Associated Virus Biology Section, MPTB, NIDCR](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/conducted-at-nidcr/investigators/john-chiorini)).
