## Research Interests

Many diurnal primates live in social groups with individuals typically interacting frequently and intimately within their own group and rarely with individuals outside of their group. The resulting dynamic and hierarchical contact patterns constrain microbial transmission and fundamentally determine the fate of outbreaks. Although social networks demonstrably influence parasite transmission and infectious disease outbreaks in wildlife populations, we know little about their impact on the mammalian gut microbiome or the downstream consequences for host physiology and health. To address this knowledge gap, my doctoral research integrates computational modeling, field behavioral observations, and molecular analyses to examine how contact networks and proximity to other host species influence bacteria transmission and gut microbiome composition in wild primates. In particular, this work focuses on a population of wild Verreaux’s sifaka inhabiting Kirindy Mitea UNESCO Biosphere in western Madagascar and is in close collaboration with Dr. Rebecca Lewis (Department of Anthropology, University of Texas at Austin), the director of a long-term sifaka research study in Kirindy Mitea, the [Sifaka Research Project](http://labs.la.utexas.edu/ankoatsifaka/sifaka-research-project/). By combining rich behavioral and bacteriological data with methods from network theory, my research aims to improve our understanding of how social interactions impact microbiome health and to inform efforts to mitigate the spread of bacteria that contribute to microbiome dysbioses or disease outbreaks in wildlife populations.

## Projects

### Hierarchical social networks shape gut microbial composition in wild sifaka ([Manuscript](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1868/20172274))
- In a multi-dimensional analysis, I relate hierarchical characteristics—including group membership, pairwise associations, and individual-level connectivity, demography, and genotype—to microbial community structure within and across seven sifaka social groups in Kirindy Mitea. 

### Terrestriality and bacterial transfer: A comparative study of gut microbiomes in sympatric Malagasy mammals (_Manuscript in press_, [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/293282))
- I examine the relative influences of diet, environment, and host evolutionary history on gut microbiome diversity and functionality among six sympatric mammal species - three primate and three non-primate - inhabiting Kirindy Mitea.

### How does sifaka social structure influence the colonization and turnover of bacterial phylotypes for individuals, groups, and the focal population? (_In progress_)
- Using 16S RNA sequence data from fecal samples collected in 2012, 2015, and 2016, I am estimating rates of phylotype gain and loss for individuals, social groups, and the population, and examining whether dynamic network characteristics, such as changes in social group composition, and individual-level attributes (_e.g._, dispersal history, developmental stage, centrality in the social network) correlate with microbiological dynamics. 

## Background

I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2009 with degrees in Biology and Ecology. My undergraduate research focused on salamander ecology and population modeling ([Maerz Lab](http://jcmaerz.wixsite.com/maerzlab), University of Georgia). After graduating, I worked as a research assistant in the [Park Lab](http://parklab.ecology.uga.edu/) (University of Georgia) investigating the environmental drivers of hemorrhagic disease outbreaks in white-tailed deer. As a National Institutes of Health post-baccalaureate fellow, I characterized viral profiles unique to Sjögren’s Syndrome ( [Adeno-Associated Virus Biology Section, MPTB, NIDCR](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/NIDCRLaboratories/MolecularPhysiology/Adeno-AssociatedVirus.htm) ). Additionally, as a research assistant with the [Fogarty International Center](https://www.fic.nih.gov/about/staff/pages/epidemiology-population.aspx), I collated data on the current state of spatial knowledge for zoonoses and emerging infectious diseases that are priority threats to US animal agriculture.
