## Research Interests

## Postdoctoral research: Epidemiology and transmission dynamics of respiratory viruses

My current research focuses on the epidemiology, ecology, and transmission dynamics of respiratory viruses in human and animal populations. 

### Ongoing research: 
- The impact of antigenic drift on seasonal influenza epidemics and vaccine effectiveness, in collaboration with [Cécile Viboud (NIH)](http://misms.net/staff/cecile-viboud/) and [Trevor Bedford's group (Fred Hutch)](https://bedford.io/),
- Influenza transmission dynamics among exhibition swine in the United States Midwest, in collaboration with [Martha Nelson (NIH)](http://misms.net/staff/martha-nelson/) and [Andrew Bowman's group (Ohio State)](https://cph.osu.edu/people/abowman)
- Short-term forecasting of COVID-19 and influenza-like illness (ILI) cases on United States military bases: [DoD Influenza Forecasting Challenge](https://predict.cdc.gov/) and DoD COVID+ILI forecasting collaboration
- Utilizing respiratory surveillance data to monitor COVID-19 activity in South Africa, in collaboration with South Africa's [National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD)](https://www.nicd.ac.za/).

## PhD Research: Ecological, Evolutionary, and Behavioral Determinants of Gut Microbiome Composition in Wild Lemurs

My doctoral research integrated field behavioral observation data, metagenomic sequencing, and computational and statistical methods to examine how contact networks and proximity to other host species influence putative bacteria transmission and gut microbiome composition in wild primates. This research focused on a population of wild Verreaux’s sifaka inhabiting Kirindy Mitea UNESCO Biosphere in western Madagascar and was in close collaboration with Rebecca Lewis (Department of Anthropology, University of Texas at Austin), the director of a long-term sifaka research study in Kirindy Mitea (the [Sifaka Research Project](http://labs.la.utexas.edu/ankoatsifaka/sifaka-research-project/)).

### Projects

### Hierarchical social networks shape gut microbial composition in wild sifaka ([Manuscript](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1868/20172274))
- In a multi-dimensional analysis, I related hierarchical characteristics — including group membership, pairwise associations, and individual-level connectivity, demography, and genotype - to gut microbial community structure and diversity within and across seven sifaka social groups in Kirindy Mitea. 

### Terrestriality and bacterial transfer: A comparative study of gut microbiomes in sympatric Malagasy mammals ([Manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/293282))
- I examined the relative influences of diet, environment, and host evolutionary history on gut microbiome diversity and functionality among six sympatric mammal species - three primate and three non-primate - inhabiting Kirindy Mitea.

### Social groups constrain the temporal dynamics of wild sifaka gut microbiomes (_Manuscript in prep_)
- Using behavioral, demographic, and microbial data collected across multiple years, I examined how host contact networks and individual-level attributes correlate with gut microbial turnover in Verreaux's sifaka. 

## Background

I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2009 with degrees in Biology and Ecology. My undergraduate research focused on salamander ecology and population modeling ([Maerz Lab](http://jcmaerz.wixsite.com/maerzlab), University of Georgia). After graduating, I worked as a research assistant in the [Park Lab](http://parklab.ecology.uga.edu/) (University of Georgia) investigating the environmental drivers of hemorrhagic disease outbreaks in white-tailed deer. As a National Institutes of Health post-baccalaureate fellow, I characterized viral profiles unique to Sjögren’s Syndrome ( [Adeno-Associated Virus Biology Section, MPTB, NIDCR](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/NIDCRLaboratories/MolecularPhysiology/Adeno-AssociatedVirus.htm) ). Additionally, as a research assistant with the [Fogarty International Center](https://www.fic.nih.gov/about/staff/pages/epidemiology-population.aspx), I collated data on the current state of spatial knowledge for zoonoses and emerging infectious diseases that are priority threats to US animal agriculture.
