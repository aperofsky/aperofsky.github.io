## Research Interests

Infectious diseases in non-human primates are a major conservation and public health concern as many species approach extinction and the threat of zoonotic emergence grows. However, our ability to assess disease risk and to detect and mitigate disease outbreaks in wildlife populations is hampered by insufficient access to data and a relatively limited understanding of disease emergence and dynamics. My research aims to address these challenges by focusing on an endangered lemur species, Verreaux’s sifaka, inhabiting Kirindy Mitea National Park in western Madagascar. Many diurnal primates live in social groups with individuals typically interacting frequently and intimately within their own group and rarely with individuals outside of their group. The resulting dynamic and hierarchical contact patterns constrain microbial transmission and fundamentally determine the fate of outbreaks. By coupling rich behavioral and bacteriological data with methods from network theory, I am building extensible and predictive models linking two underlying factors—social behavior and proximity to other species—to bacteria acquisition and disease risk. This work is in close collaboration with [Dr. Rebecca J. Lewis](http://liberalarts.utexas.edu/anthropology/faculty/profile.php?id=rl2273) (Department of Anthropology, University of Texas at Austin), the director of Ankoatsifaka Research Station and the [Sifaka Research Project](http://labs.la.utexas.edu/ankoatsifaka/sifaka-research-project/).

## Projects

### Hierarchical social networks shape gut microbial composition in wild sifaka (_Manuscript in press_)
- In a multi-dimensional analysis, I related hierarchical characteristics—including group membership, pairwise associations, and individual-level connectivity, demography, and genotype—to microbial community structure within and across seven sifaka social groups in Kirindy Mitea National Park. 

### Gut microbiome diversity across sympatric mammal populations of Madagascar reflects diet, habitat use, and host phylogeny (_Manuscript drafted_)
- I examined the relative influences of diet, habitat overlap, and host evolutionary history on gut microbiome diversity and composition among six sympatric mammal species (red-fronted brown lemurs, red-tailed sportive lemurs, Verreaux’s sifaka, cattle, fossa, and bush pigs) inhabiting Kirindy Mitea National Park.

### How does sifaka social structure influence the colonization and turnover of bacterial phylotypes for individuals, groups, and the focal population? (_In progress_)
- Using 16S RNA sequences from fecal samples collected in 2012, 2015, and 2016, I am estimating rates of phylotype gain and loss for individuals, groups, and the population, and examining whether dynamic network characteristics, such as changes in social group composition, and individual-level attributes (_e.g._, dispersal history, developmental stage, centrality in the social network) correlate with microbiological dynamics. 

### How do social networks shape between-host transmission dynamics of opportunistic bacterial pathogens? (_In progress_)

## Background

I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2009 with degrees in Biology and Ecology. My undergraduate research focused on salamander ecology and population modeling ([Maerz Lab](http://jcmaerz.wixsite.com/maerzlab), University of Georgia). After graduating, I worked as a research assistant in the [Park Lab](http://parklab.ecology.uga.edu/) (University of Georgia) investigating the environmental drivers of hemorrhagic disease outbreaks in white-tailed deer. As a National Institutes of Health post-baccalaureate fellow, I characterized viral profiles unique to Sjögren’s Syndrome ( [Adeno-Associated Virus Biology Section, MPTB, NIDCR](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/NIDCRLaboratories/MolecularPhysiology/Adeno-AssociatedVirus.htm) ). Additionally, as a research assistant with the [Fogarty International Center](https://www.fic.nih.gov/about/staff/pages/epidemiology-population.aspx), I collated data on the current state of spatial knowledge for zoonoses and emerging infectious diseases that are priority threats to US animal agriculture.
