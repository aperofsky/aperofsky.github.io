## Research Interests

Infectious diseases in non-human primates are a major conservation and public health concern as many species approach extinction and the threat of zoonotic emergence grows. However, our ability to assess disease risk and to detect and mitigate disease outbreaks in wildlife populations is hampered by insufficient access to data and a relatively limited understanding of disease emergence and dynamics. My research aims to address these challenges by focusing on an endangered lemur species, Verreaux’s sifaka, inhabiting Kirindy Mitea National Park in western Madagascar. Many diurnal primates live in social groups with individuals typically interacting frequently and intimately within their own group and rarely with individuals outside of their group. The resulting dynamic and hierarchical contact patterns constrain disease transmission and fundamentally determine the fate of outbreaks. By coupling rich behavioral and bacteriological data with methods from network theory, I am building extensible and predictive models linking two underlying factors—social behavior and proximity to other species—to disease risk. This work is in close collaboration with [Dr. Rebecca J. Lewis](http://liberalarts.utexas.edu/anthropology/faculty/profile.php?id=rl2273) (Department of Anthropology, University of Texas at Austin).


### Background

I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2009 with degrees in Biology and Ecology. My undergraduate research focused on salamander ecology and population modeling ([Maerz Lab](http://jcmaerz.wixsite.com/maerzlab), University of Georgia). After graduating, I worked as a research assistant in the [Park Lab](http://parklab.ecology.uga.edu/) (University of Georgia) investigating the environmental drivers of hemorrhagic disease outbreaks in white-tailed deer. As a National Institutes of Health post-baccalaureate fellow, I characterized viral profiles unique to Sjögren’s Syndrome ( [Adeno-Associated Virus Biology Section, MPTB, NIDCR](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/NIDCRLaboratories/MolecularPhysiology/Adeno-AssociatedVirus.htm) ). Additionally, as a research assistant with the [Fogarty International Center](https://www.fic.nih.gov/about/staff/pages/epidemiology-population.aspx), I collated data on the current state of spatial knowledge for zoonoses and emerging infectious diseases that are priority threats to US animal agriculture.
