I'm an infectious disease ecologist working as research scientist in the [Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine (BBI)](https://brotmanbaty.org/) at the University of Washington. My research broadly focuses on the ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral drivers of respiratory virus infections, with aims to improve infectious disease surveillance and better understand and predict recurring and emerging outbreaks. I apply a variety of statistical and computational approaches to diverse data sets (surveillance, genomic sequences, serology, and mobility) to study respiratory virus transmission patterns and epidemiology, with a particular focus on influenza and SARS-CoV-2. I also produce operational forecasts and projections of respiratory virus outbreaks.

At BBI, I work with [Seattle Flu Alliance](https://seattleflu.org/) investigators to study how population-level behavior shapes the transmission dynamics of endemic respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in Seattle, Washington. Prior to joining UW, I completed my PhD in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior with [Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyers](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/) at the University of Texas at Austin and a postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Cécile Viboud at the [Fogarty International Center](https://www.fic.nih.gov/About/Staff/Pages/epidemiology-population.aspx), National Institutes of Health.
