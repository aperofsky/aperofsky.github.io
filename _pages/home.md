I'm a PhD candidate in [Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyer's research group](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/) at The University of Texas at Austin.<br>

My dissertation research combines math and statistical modeling, field behavioral observations, and molecular analyses to study how temporal contact networks in wildlife influence bacteria transmission. In particular, my work focuses on Verreaux's sifaka (_Propithecus verreauxi_), an endangered primate species that inhabits the dry forests of western Madagascar.
