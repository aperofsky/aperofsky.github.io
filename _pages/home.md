My research broadly focuses on the ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral drivers of respiratory virus infections, with aims to improve infectious disease surveillance and better understand and predict recurring and emerging outbreaks. I apply a variety of statistical and computational approaches to diverse data sets (surveillance, genomic, immunity, and mobility) to study respiratory virus transmission patterns and epidemiology, with a particular focus on influenza and SARS-CoV-2.

I'm a research scientist in the [Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine](https://brotmanbaty.org/) at the University of Washington. At BBI, I work with [Seattle Flu Alliance](https://seattleflu.org/) investigators to study how population behavior impacts the transmission dynamics of endemic respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in Seattle, Washington. Prior to joining UW, I completed my PhD in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior in [Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyer's lab](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/) at The University of Texas at Austin and a postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Cécile Viboud at the [Fogarty International Center](https://www.fic.nih.gov/About/Staff/Pages/epidemiology-population.aspx), National Institutes of Health. 

During my postgraduate training, I have linked the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of influenza in the United States, measured the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare seeking behavior in South Africa, characterized the spread of influenza across a network of exhibition swine shows in the US Midwest, and produced operational forecasts and projections of respiratory virus outbreaks. For my PhD at UT-Austin, I studied how host contact networks and proximity to other host species influence the gut microbial communities of wild lemurs in Madagascar.
