I am currently a sixth-year PhD student in the [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior](https://www.cns.utexas.edu/eeb-graduate-program) program at The University of Texas at Austin advised by [Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyers](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/). <br>

My hobbies outside of science are [college radio](https://kvrx.org), riding my motorcycle, hiking, and seeing live music. For the past six years, I've hosted a weekly specialty show on KVRX 91.7 that focuses on psych, prog, and early electronic - some past episodes can be found on [mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/amanda-perofsky/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEroWMrtC54xit3wEkDLkuw). 

### Background
I grew up in Macon, Georgia and graduated from the University of Georgia in 2009 with degrees in Biology and Ecology. My undergraduate research focused on salamander ecology and population modeling ([Maerz Lab](http://jcmaerz.wixsite.com/maerzlab), University of Georgia). After graduating, I worked as a research assistant in the [Park Lab](http://parklab.ecology.uga.edu/) (University of Georgia) investigating the environmental drivers of hemorrhagic disease outbreaks in white-tailed deer. As a National Institutes of Health post-baccalaureate fellow, I characterized viral profiles unique to Sjögren’s Syndrome ( [Adeno-Associated Virus Biology Section, MPTB, NIDCR](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/NIDCRLaboratories/MolecularPhysiology/Adeno-AssociatedVirus.htm) ). Additionally, as a research assistant with the [Fogarty International Center](https://www.fic.nih.gov/about/staff/pages/epidemiology-population.aspx), I collated data on the current state of spatial knowledge for zoonoses and emerging infectious diseases that are priority threats to US animal agriculture.
