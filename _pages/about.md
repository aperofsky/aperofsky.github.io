I grew up in Macon, Georgia and currently live in Seattle, Washington. My hobbies include hiking, motorcycles, and seeing live music. For six years, I hosted a weekly radio show on KVRX 91.7 (UT-Austin's volunteer, student-run radio station) that focused on psych, prog, and early electronic. Some past episodes and playlists are on [mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/amanda-perofsky/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEroWMrtC54xit3wEkDLkuw).
