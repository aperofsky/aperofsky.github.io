I am currently a sixth-year PhD student in the [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior](https://www.cns.utexas.edu/eeb-graduate-program) program at The University of Texas at Austin. <br>

I grew up in Macon, Georgia and have also lived in Athens, Georgia and Washington, D.C. My hobbies outside of science are [college radio](https://kvrx.org), riding my motorcycle, hiking, and seeing live music. For the past six years, I've hosted a weekly radio show on KVRX 91.7 that focuses on psych, prog, and early electronic - some past episodes can be found on [mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/amanda-perofsky/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEroWMrtC54xit3wEkDLkuw).
