I grew up in Macon, Georgia and have also lived in Athens, Georgia and Washington, D.C. My hobbies outside of science are [college radio](https://kvrx.org), motorcycles, hiking, and seeing live music. For six years, I hosted a [weekly radio show](http://www.kvrx.org/schedule/programs/275) on KVRX 91.7 (UT's volunteer, student-run radio station) that focused on psych, prog, and early electronic - some past episodes and playlists are on [mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/amanda-perofsky/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEroWMrtC54xit3wEkDLkuw).
