I'm a PhD candidate in Integrative Biology at the University of Texas at Austin advised by Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyers. <br>

My dissertation research combines statistical and math modeling, field observations, and molecular analyses to study the temporal dynamics of contact networks in group-living wildlife and their impacts on the spread of intestinal bacteria. Specifically, my work focuses on Verreauxâ€™s sifaka (_Propithecus verreauxi_), an endangered primate species that inhabits the dry forests of western Madagascar.
