I'm an infectious disease ecologist and Research Assistant Professor in the [Bouvé College of Health Sciences](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern University, with joint appointments in the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/), [Roux Institute](https://roux.northeastern.edu/), and [Institute for Experiential AI](https://ai.northeastern.edu/). 

My research broadly focuses on the ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral drivers of infectious disease dynamics, with aims to improve disease surveillance and better understand and predict future outbreaks. Specifically, I combine statistical, mathematical, and computational approaches to investigate respiratory virus transmission patterns and epidemiology, with a focus on influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. I also produce operational forecasts and scenario projections of respiratory virus outbreaks. 

Previously, I worked as a research scientist with the [Seattle Flu Study](https://seattleflu.org/), a large-scale respiratory illness surveillance study led by researchers from the University of Washington, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle Children's, and National Institutes of Health. I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Fogarty International Center, NIH with [Dr. Cécile Viboud](https://www.fic.nih.gov/About/Staff/epidemiology-population-studies), and earned my PhD in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior from the University of Texas at Austin with [Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyers](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/).
