Influenza viruses continually accumulate genetic changes in epitopes of two major surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), in a process called "antigenic drift." Antigenic drift enables flu viruses to evade immune recognition, leaving previously exposed individuals susceptible to reinfection and requiring regular updates to the flu vaccine. Antigenic drift is expected to increase host susceptibility, leading to more flu cases and in turn earlier, larger, or more severe epidemics. However, epidemiological evidence for the impact of antigenic evolution on seasonal flu outbreaks is conflicting.

In a recent _eLife_ article, we compared experimental and sequence-based measures of A(H3N2) virus evolution in predicting regional epidemic dynamics in the U.S. across 22 flu seasons (1997-2019), while also accounting for the co-circulation of other flu types/subtypes, prior population immunity, and vaccination ([Perofsky et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.91849)). We found that evolution in both major surface proteins contributes to variability in epidemic magnitude across seasons, although viral evolution appears to be secondary to subtype interference in shaping annual outbreaks. When comparing the predictive performance of different evolutionary indicators, genetic changes in broad sets of epitope sites had stronger, more consistent relationships with A(H3N2) epidemic dynamics than the serological assays traditionally used to measure antigenic changes. As an extension of this work, we are exploring the impacts of antigenic drift, prior population immunity, and egg-adaptive mutations on A(H3N2) vaccine effectiveness in the U.S.

Each summer in the U.S., youths attending agricultural fairs are exposed to genetically diverse influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulating in exhibition swine, leading to hundreds of zoonotic infections since 2010. Exhibition swine, comprising 1.5% of the U.S. herd, present a targeted opportunity to mitigate a pandemic threat. We analyzed virologic surveillance data from thousands of pigs at 350 national, state, and local swine exhibitions across several states during 2016–2018. 

Key findings: 
* An early-season national show played a key role in the propagation and spread of a specific virus (H1 δ-2) among exhibition swine, leading to the majority of zoonotic infections in the US during 2018 ([Nelson, Perofsky, et al. 2020 _J. Virol._](https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01453-20)). 
* The earlier timing of jackpot shows and long-distance travel of pigs for repeated showing provide a pathway for the introduction of influenza into county fairs ([McBride† and Perofsky† et al. 2021 _JID_](https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab122)). Unlike state and county fairs, jackpot shows focus solely on swine and are held at the start of the show season.
