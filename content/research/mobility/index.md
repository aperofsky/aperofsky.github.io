title: "Human Mobility and Respiratory Virus Transmission"
---

During the COVID-19 pandemic, mobile phone location data became crucial for tracking population movements and evaluating control strategies for SARS-CoV-2. I began working with cellphone mobility data in 2020, first to forecast COVID-19 outbreaks on military bases for U.S. DoD, and later to analyze relationships between population mobility and [healthcare-seeking behavior in South Africa](https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciac055) and [respiratory virus transmission in Seattle](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48528-2).

## Mobility behavior and respiratory virus transmission dynamics in the Seattle metropolitan area

Mobility data have been used extensively to model SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, but relationships between mobility behavior and the transmission of endemic respiratory pathogens remain less understood. As a research scientist for the [Seattle Flu Study](https://seattleflu.org/), I investigated how mobility behavior and COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions influenced the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and 17 endemic respiratory viruses in Seattle during pre- and post-pandemic years ([Perofsky et al. 2024 _Nat. Commun._](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48528-2)). Building on this work, we are using mechanistic transmission models to study the combined effects of waning immunity and decreased social distancing on the post-pandemic reemergence of RSV in Seattle ([preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.13.24313667v1)). I have also collaborated with [Trevor Bedford's group at Fred Hutch](https://bedford.io/) to link cellphone mobility patterns to the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in [Seattle-King County](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012117) and [Washington state](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08637-4).
