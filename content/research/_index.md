My research focuses on the ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral drivers of respiratory virus dynamics, with a particular emphasis on seasonal influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2.

## Current Research

- [Linking human mobility to respiratory virus transmission dynamics](/research/mobility/) — How population movement patterns shape the spread of respiratory pathogens

- [Influenza ecology and evolution](/research/influenza/) — The role of antigenic drift and subtype interference in seasonal flu epidemics

- [Disease forecasting](/research/forecasting/) — Operational forecasts and scenario projections for respiratory virus outbreaks

## Past Research

- [PhD: Gut microbiomes in wild mammals](/research/phd/) — How social networks and proximity to other host species shape gut microbial communities in Malagasy lemurs
