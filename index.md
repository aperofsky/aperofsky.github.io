I'm a research scientist in the [Brotman Baty Institute](https://brotmanbaty.org/) at the University of Washington School of Medicine. At BBI, I work with the [Seattle Flu Study](https://seattleflu.org/) to study the impact of social distancing on endemic respiratory pathogens in the Seattle.

Prior to joining UW, I completed my PhD in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior in [Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyer's lab](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/) at The University of Texas at Austin and a postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. CÃ©cile Viboud at the Fogarty International Center ([DIEPS](https://www.fic.nih.gov/About/Staff/Pages/epidemiology-population.aspx)), National Institutes of Health.
