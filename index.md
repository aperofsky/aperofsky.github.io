I'm an infectious disease ecologist and guest researcher at the [Fogarty International Center](https://www.fic.nih.gov/), [U.S. National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/). My research combines statistical, mathematical, and computational approaches to study respiratory virus transmission patterns and epidemiology, with aims to improve disease surveillance and better understand and predict future outbreaks. I also produce operational forecasts and scenario projections of respiratory virus outbreaks.

I previously worked as a research scientist with the [Seattle Flu Study](https://seattleflu.org/) at the University of Washington and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Fogarty International Center with [Dr. CÃ©cile Viboud](https://www.fic.nih.gov/About/Staff/Pages/epidemiology-population.aspx). I earned my PhD in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior from the University of Texas at Austin, under the direction of [Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyers](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/).

During my postgraduate training, I have related cellphone mobility to respiratory virus transmission at the city scale, linked the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of influenza in the United States, measured the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare seeking behavior in South Africa, and characterized the spread of influenza in a network of exhibition swine shows in the U.S. Midwest. For my PhD at UT-Austin, I studied how social network structure shapes the gut microbiomes of wild lemurs in Madagascar.
