I'm a PhD candidate in [Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyer's research group](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/) at The University of Texas at Austin. <br>

My dissertation research combines computational modeling, field behavioral observations, and molecular analyses to study how contact networks influence bacteria transmission and gut microbiome composition in group-living wildlife. In particular, my work focuses on a population of wild lemurs (Verreaux's sifaka, _Propithecus verreauxi_) inhabiting Kirindy Mitea National Park in western Madagascar.
